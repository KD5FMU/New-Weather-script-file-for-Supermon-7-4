# New-Weather-script-file-for-Supermon-7-4
### This is the updated weather.sh file for Supermon 7.4 created by Mike Webb WG5EEK and Paul Aidukas KN2R in October 2025 ###

To install it you first should backup your existing file
```
sudo mv /usr/local/sbin/supermon/weather.sh /usr/local/sbin/supermon/weather.sh.bak
```
Then we can download the new file.
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KD5FMU/New-Weather-script-file-for-Supermon-7-4/refs/heads/main/weather.sh
```
Then you need to make it executable, so from the /usr/local/sbin/supermon/ folder type
```
sudo chmod +x weather.sh
```

### So then you can edit the weather.sh file to meet your needs if you want ###
